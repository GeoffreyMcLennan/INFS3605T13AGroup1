Hello and welcome to our INFS3605 Next Generation Emergency Communication App!

This application was created in Android Studio and developed using Java. 
It can be run on an emulator in Android Studio and also transported to an android device that has developer mode enabled.
For a full walkthrough of the codes functionality refer to the attached video pitch where James will lead you through the 
key functionalities of the application. There are no passwords necessary for the application although you will need to 
accept the permissions the application asks of your emulator to make use of the full suite of features. 

We hope you enjoy the app, Thanks, Group 1 T13 A (Link Developers).
